# What are you trying to do?

--

Predict serious housing code violations in NYC

--

# Who cares?

--

#### New Yorkers living in rental housing

--

* Prediction could help to reduce the frequency/severity of violations
  
--

#### NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD)

--

* Prediction could improve efficient/effective use limited resources

--

#### Community Organizations (eg. [Heat Seek](http://heatseek.org/), [JustFix.nyc](http://www.justfix.nyc/))

--

* Prediction could improve targeting of resources for outreach

---
class: left, top

# What will success look like?

Sufficently accurate predictions to be helpful to HPD and/or community organizations

--

Include estimated liklihood of violations to allow tageting resources

--

Interpretable model to provide some understanding strongest predictors

--

Effective measures taken to minimize potential biases in models
  * eg. Communities less likely to report violations 

--

# What impact will it have?

Premptive HPD inpections could prevent violations or reduce their severity or duration
