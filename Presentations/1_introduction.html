Predict serious housing code violations in NYC

#### New Yorkers living in rental housing

--

# What will success look like?

Sufficently accurate predictions to be helpful to HPD and/or community organizations

--

Include estimated liklihood of violations to allow tageting resources

--

Interpretable model to provide some understanding strongest predictors

--

Effective measures taken to minimize potential biases in models
  * eg. Communities less likely to report violations 

--

# What impact will it have?

Premptive HPD inpections could prevent violations or reduce their severity or duration
