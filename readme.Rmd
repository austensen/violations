Overview
--------

The purpose of this project is to to predict serious housing code violations in multi-family rental building in New York City. All data is taken from publically available sources, and is organized at the borough-block-lot (BBL) level. The plan is to use all data available in 2015 to predict violations in 2016.

To-Do
-----

* Switch over from HPD website to NYC open data (charges, and complaints)

* Run basic descriptives on final sample data
    * Overall prevelence of (serious) housing code violations
    * ...
    
* Deal with missing data problems
    * Impute missing data
      * simple mean imputation, 
      * mean by zipcode and/or builing type, 
      * should also see if missing-not-at-random
      * look for values in past years of data (older pluto/rpad versions), 
      * regressions using other variables
    
* Add to evaluation of models using tests reccomended in Dietterich (1997) reading
